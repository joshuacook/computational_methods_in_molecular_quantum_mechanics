    "Eigenequation\n",
    ":    a relationship describing a vector or function that is invariant with respect to a given linear operator. Given an operator $\\Gamma: \\mathbb{F}^n \\to \\mathbb{F}^n$, where $\\mathbb{F}^n$ represents either the Real or Complex field of dimenion $n$, $\\Gamma$ is said to be in the set of linear operators over the space $\\mathbb{F}^n$. Then, $\\lambda$ and $\\psi$ are said to be an eigenvalue and eigenvector respectively of the linear operator $\\Gamma$, if $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{F}$, $\\psi\\neq0$ and $\\Gamma\\psi=\\lambda\\psi$ ([@eq:eigenequation])\n",

In other words, $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})=\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty c_i\\phi_i$$ ([@eq:linear_combination]), where $\\Gamma \\phi_i = a_i\\phi_i$.\n",
