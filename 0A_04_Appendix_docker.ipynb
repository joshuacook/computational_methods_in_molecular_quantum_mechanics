    "Docker is a virtualization technology we can use to maintain a reusable data science system for performing the tasks in this text. Docker's ecosystem consists of Containers, Images, Nodes, Services, and Stacks as well as two cloud services we will take advantage of, Docker Hub and Docker Cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "A container is a stripped down Linux operating system. An image is software you provision into a container. A node is container that lives in the cloud (we will use Digital Ocean) where we can host our images. A service is a specific image running in our node, that may or may not be available to other services running on that node. A stack is a collection of services including the links between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter provides opinionated stacks [@jupyter_stacks] for use in a variety of contexts. We are essentially interested in the `datascience-notebook` with a slight modification. I often like using an ORM to interface with my datasets, in particular, the python `mongoengine` [@mongoengine] library for interfacing with MongoDB [@mongodb]. Jupyter does not include this library with its stack, nor is it easily available using the `conda` tool that is used to install most of the python data science stack. In order to have it included we are going to have to build our own Docker container image. The beauty of docker is that we do not have to start from scratch. We begin with the Jupyter minimal image and add only the additional components we need, in this case, `mongoengine`."
