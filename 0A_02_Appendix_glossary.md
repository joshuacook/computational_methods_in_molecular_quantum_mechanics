Adjoint
:    rises in many fields of mathematics.  It can be defined in infinite-dimensional complex scalar product spaces (finite-dimensional case).

Boundary Conditions
:    \ 

Classical Mechanics
:    no limitations in the accuracy with which observables may be measured.

Complete Basis Set
:    In a particular space a list of vectors or functions that is linearly independent and spans the space. 

Continuous 
:   A set of data is said to be continuous if the values belonging to the set can take on ANY value within a finite or infinite interval.  Some examples in quantum mechanics are position and momentum.

Difference Matrix
:    \ 

Differentiable
:    \ 

Differential Operator
:    \ 

Discrete
:    A set of data is said to be discrete if the values belonging to the set are distinct and separate (unconnected values).  An example in quantum mechanics is spin states.

Eigenequation
:    a relationship describing a vector or function that is invariant with respect to a given linear operator. Given an operator $\Gamma: \mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^n$, where $\mathbb{F}^n$ represents either the Real or Complex field of dimenion $n$, $\Gamma$ is said to be in the set of linear operators over the space $\mathbb{F}^n$. Then, $\lambda$ and $\psi$ are said to be an eigenvalue and eigenvector respectively of the linear operator $\Gamma$, if $\lambda\in\mathbb{F}$, $\psi\neq0$ and $\Gamma\psi=\lambda\psi$ ([@eq:eigenequation])

Eigenfunction
:    \ 

Eigenvector
:    it’s a measurable quantity known as observables in quantum mechanics.

Eigenvalue
:    if we are given the following equation:  , then the eigenvalue of an operator  is .

Energy
:    the sum of potential and kinetic energies  where  is kinetic energy and  is potential energy.

Hamiltonian Operator
:    Classically, the Hamiltonian corresponds to the total energy of a system. The Hamiltonian operator is the corresponding quantum mechanical operator and is equal to the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators. 
:    $H=T+V=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V$ ([@eq:definition_hamiltonian])
:    The expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator is an associated energy, $E$ that is totally conserved. 

Invertible
:    \ 

Kinetic Energy
:    \ 

Linear Combination
:    Given a complete set of basis functions, it is possible to write a wavefunction describing the state of a system as a linear combination of this basis set. In other words, $\psi(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{i=1}^\infty c_i\phi_i$$ ([@eq:linear_combination]), where $\Gamma \phi_i = a_i\phi_i$.

Self-Adjoint Linear Operator
:    The adjoint of a linear operator $L$ is the unique linear operator $L^*$ that satisfies
:    $\llangle L[u],v\rrangle = \langle u,L^*v\rangle$ ([@eq:adjoint])
:    An operator is called self-adjoint if $L=L^*$. For a self-adjoint operator, the eigenvalues are real and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.
